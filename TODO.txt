Add, in the generated comments, also the source file

Enable some sort of submodules within the same skeleton file
so that variables can be consistently shared

ATTENTION: names are generated alphabetically and this can change the
semantics of the member-wise constructor!

also deal with \t characters

Generate also Java code.

Implement "default" and "required"

IF BRANCH

don't use METHOD_TYPE and other types and rely on derived classes?

memorizzarsi in tabelle le varie variabili e metodi cosi' che non
sia necessario tutte le volte riesaminare tutti gli elementi.

reimplement templates with @if@ as much as possible
(e.g. class.h_skel and constructors)

does not update indent after an @ENDIF@ without any \n after:

@ENDIF@
  @foo@
  
@cond exp ? then : else cond@ (alias for if then else)

STRUCTURED DATA
---------------

@myvar:MyStruct.field:string@ NO
@myvar:MyStruct.myfield:MyOtherStruct@ NO

@myvar:MyStruct.field@ YES

type is inferred in expressions

generate #line so that the C compiler can report an error due, e.g.,
to a missing field.

check for null

@if@ myvar:MyStruct == null @then@

pass a pointer both in C and C++

LOOPS
-----

@iterator var@

@var@ contains the current value

@next(var)@ says whether there's another element

@enditerator@

typed iterator

@iterator var:MyStruct@

@var@ contains the current value

@next(var)@ says whether there's another element

@enditerator@

TYPES
-----

check use of gnulib

Version 1.4

* remove possible path information passed with --file-name
* --output-dir option added

Version 1.3

* updated gnulib configure macros
* use --docdir if specified for installing documentation

Version 1.2

* better checks for getopt_long and strdup (using gnulib)
* removed non-standard make rules
* updated to version 3 of GPL

Version 1.1

* distribution of cmdline.ggo whose absence caused make failures in
  doc directory (thanks to Bob White)

Version 1.0

* First GNU release
* conditional statements expressions can be complex
  (not single variables)
* variables can also have types bool and int

Version 0.6

* conditional statements in template files
* the sequence @x@@y@ is now recognized correctly
  as two variables
* before actually generating the file, check whether
  it is different from a possible previous generation

Version 0.5.1

* removed memory leaks in generated C files

Version 0.5

* C code can be generated instead of C++ code
* if an item is of type "method" it can still be assigned a string
and in that case the method is not invoked (the same holds for C external
functions)
* correctly reset the indent counter to 0 when it encounters a new
line and no spaces at the beginning of the line
* --expand-tabs option added that allows to correctly indent
strings with newlines inside.

Version 0.4.4

* fixed some compilation problems under SunOS (thanks to
Dinesh Shanbhag <dshanbhag@hotmail.com>)
* presence of getopt_long is handled in a cleaner way

Version 0.4.3

* in the generated code config.h is not included anymore
(it's useless)

Version 0.4.2

* generate code compliant to new C++ standard headers: removed warnings
with gcc 3.2

Version 0.4.1

* if separated files are generated, no default value (= 0) for indent
is generated (it is already specified in the header file).  This caused
some problems with some gcc 3.x.
